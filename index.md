# Hello!
I'm Yu-Chieh Ho (何宇傑), currently working as a senior data scientist in [MoMagic Technologies](https://www.momagic.com/), led the design and development of data monetization products and collaborated with cross-functional stakeholders on end-to-end product optimization (e.g., problem formulation, model building, proof of concept (PoC) and deployment). 

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) and developed solid professional skills, especially machine learning and data mining when working with Prof. Jane Yung-jen Hsu in [Intelligent Agents (iAgents) Lab](https://iagentntu.github.io/) and Prof. Thomas S.
Huang in [Image Formation and Processing (IFP) group](https://ifp-uiuc.github.io/), [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).

# Selected Research Projects
## Learning User Preference from Heterogeneous Data 
![project_vreeg](assets/img/e2e_dnn_rec.png)
_2015 [iAgents Lab](https://iagentntu.github.io/) & [IFP group](https://ifp-uiuc.github.io/)_  
We present DEERS, a deep end-to-end learning framework for recommender systems (RS). 
To fulfill the various recommendation contexts, DEERS integrates collaborative filtering (CF) 
based and content-based recommendation methods into one deep end-to-end neural network to properly 
utilize all available information when modeling user preferences.
![project_vreeg](assets/img/individual_rec_exp.jpg)
DEERS provides modularized interfaces for additional inputs and flexible model structure for various 
recommendation scenarios and heterogeneous inputs. Moreover, it can capture more sophisticated features 
by considering the interaction between source data. We evaluated proposed framework under two different 
real-life scenarios:  individual recommendation and group recommendation on two real-world heterogeneous 
datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that DEERS holds above good properties and its performance 
surpassed the state-of-the-art approaches.

## Mining Worth-Recommending Items from Long Tails by Modeling Relative Preference
![project_vreeg](assets/img/wsdm_approach.png)
_2014 [iAgents Lab](https://iagentntu.github.io/)_  
we focus on long-tail item promotion and aggregate diversity enhancement, and propose a novel approach 
which diversifies the results of recommender systems by considering “recommendations” as resources to be 
allocated to the items. Our approach increases the quantity and quality of long-tail item recommendations 
by adding more variation into the recommendation and maintains a certain level of accuracy simultaneously. 
![project_vreeg](assets/img/wsdm_exp.png)
The experimental results show that this approach can discover more worth- recommending items from Long Tails and improves user experience.

## Cloud-enabled ADL Recognition and Service Inference Technology
![project_vreeg](assets/img/cloud_ar.png)
_2011 [Intelligent Robot Lab](https://robotlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/member)_  
Ｗe propose an architecture, in which many health-care applications and services can easily
build upon, for collective long-term ADL pattern analysisvthat leverages several prominent advantages inherent in
cloud computing. The core of the proposed infrastructure includes a module to perform MapReduce-assisted
Bayesian activity recognition based on all collected ADL data. Better yet, the resultant data analysis can be delivered
as a service from a service station which serves as a readily accessible interface to 3rd party service providers and end users.

# Selected Industrial Projects
## Data-Driven Market Segmentation
Built and evaluated machine learning models for Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion per Impression (CPI) improvement and Gender Prediction using TensorFlow, Keras and scikit-learn:  

![project_vreeg](assets/img/pro_Market_Segmentation.png)  
_2018-2019, [MoMagic Technologies](https://www.momagic.com/)_

- Distribution based App-Category model:  
Generate segments by analyzing App-installing distribution within each App-Category. Positive results from 3 (out of 4) on-line tests. The CPI (Conversion per Impression) of provided segments surpassed generic users by 40%-500%.

- 2-Winged Deep Neural Network based Segment Recommender:  
Generate customized segments for each campaign by extracting low-rank user / campaign representations using deep neural networks. Positive results from 2 (out of 2) off-line tests. The segment CPI surpassed original human targeting by 31%-34% and more importantly, it kept more than 90% net_installs.

## Machine Learning Enabled Real-Time Bidding (RTB) Enhancement
Built the first data science team for this company and delivered two machine learning solutions 
for real-time bidding (RTB) monitoring. Collaborated with cross-functional developers and 
deployed proposed solution on the RTB system.

_2017, Quadas_
- Intelligent Transaction Monitor:   
A system developed to detect abnormal 
transactions by multidimensional monitoring 
the real-time bidding (RTB) processes to prevent 
over-bidding. Experimental results showed this 
solution detected all over-bidding events in the 
testing set with only 35-55 false alarms 
(out of 1917 test events). 

![project_vreeg](assets/img/pro_fraud_detect.png)
- Deep-based Fraud Detector: 
A deep learning enabled anti-fraud approach which filters out ad-fraud and helps the RTB system 
to bid on high-value traffics. Experimental results showed this solution saved 40% media cost with 
only 15%-30% conversion loss.

We designed an online learning website with an interactive commenting system and prototyped interface to visualize comments with topic and sentiment analysis. Usability testing and factorial experiment with learners and instructors was conducted to evaluate the effect and desired benefits of our systems. We reported the evaluation result in both qualitatively and quantitatively fashions.
